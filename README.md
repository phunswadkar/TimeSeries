# Time Series Analytics | Monthly Sales Forecasting of a Supplement Manufacturing Comapny : Vitacost


The scope of this project is to help Vitacost do an effective analysis of their current sales trends based on historical data and thereby help them project more effective ways and techniques to forecast and predict their upcoming business and make an informed decision for the coming times.

We have collected the monthly sales data for a period from January, 2010 through December, 2022. Our project primarily focuses on the historical data and aims to identify the best forecasting method to predict the monthly sales for the company for the year 2023.

The Time Series Forecasting and Analysis is one of the most important tools in Machine Learning/Data Mining, which is often used for predictions in various industries which involve a time component. 

We have used some of the most comparable models of Time Series Forecasting to compare Vitacost sales performance and thereby chosen some of the best models which can most accurately predict Vitacost's future sales and help them set the most realistic sales targets in the upcoming times. Models like Holt-Winterâ€™s, Regression model with linear trend and seasonality, Two-Level Model: Regression with Linear Trend and Seasonality + AR (8) for Residuals, Regression model with quadratic trend and seasonality, Two-Level Model: Regression with Quadratic Trend and Seasonality + AR (8) for Residuals and Auto Arima, were the foundation of our analysis. Accuracy of these models were further assessed using MAPE and RMSE metrics for the entire data set. 

The best model for forecasting the sales data of Vitacost for the year 2023 is the Two-Level Model: Regression with Quadratic Trend and Seasonality + AR (8) for Residuals. We have constructed these models using R as the statistical tool and have tried to learn some of the unexplored relationships in the historical sales data of Vitacost, via various Graphs and Time Series components.
